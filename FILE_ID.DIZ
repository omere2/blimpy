This litte game was made in QBasic
on the summer between the 6th and
the 7th grades, It was made on the
first year Amit and I were introduced
to the programming world, so it's not
so good and elegant, anyway it's a cool
game and we were very excited doing it,
but unfortunatly there are only 3 levels
because it was too difficult to program
one, we had to draw it! So, enjoy.
